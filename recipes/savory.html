            <h2>Chicken Francese</h2>
            <ul>
                Ingredients:
                For crust:
                <li>4 skinless, boneless, chicken breasts (about 11/2 pounds)</li>
                <li>All-purpose flour, for dredging</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 lemon, with rind, cut in thin rounds</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Directions:
                <ol>Put the chicken breasts side by side on a cutting board and lay a piece of plastic wrap over them. Pound the chicken breasts with a flat meat mallet, until they are about 1/4-inch thick. Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly. In a wide bowl, beat the eggs with 3 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash. Heat the oil over medium-high flame in a large skillet.</ol>
                <ol>Dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, and then dip them in the egg wash to coat completely, letting the excess drip off. When the oil is nice and hot, add the cutlets and fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden, turning once. Remove the chicken cutlets to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm.</ol>
                <ol>Toss the lemon slices into the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the wine, broth, and lemon juice, simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the sauce slightly. Roll the butter in some flour and add it to the skillet, this will thicken the sauce. Stir to incorporate and dissolve the flour. Reduce the heat to medium-low and return the chicken to the pan; place the lemon slices on top of the cutlets. Simmer gently for 2 minutes to heat the chicken through. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.</ol>

            <h2>Spaghetti Aioli</h2>
            <ul>
                Ingredients:
                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>8 to 10 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Directions:
                <ol>Boil a large pot of water. Add salt when it has boiled and add the pasta. Once the pasta has cooked to al dente (look at the package instructions), reserve a cup of the pasta water for the sauce and drain.</ol>
                <ol>Slice the garlic into thin slivers (as thin as you can). Mince the parsley. Add the olive oil to a large pot (the same one you cooked the pasta in, if you wish) and cook on medium heat. Add half of the garlic and saute until just fragrant. Then add in the salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and chopped parsley. Cook for another minute. Just be careful not to overcook or over toast the garlic. This can lessen the garlic flavor and can make the garlic taste bitter.</ol>
                <ol>Add half a cup of the reserved pasta water, the pasta and the remaining garlic. Toss and cook for another 2 minutes or until it is all heated through. Add in more pasta water if needed.</ol>
                <ol>Add the parmesan cheese and more salt to taste. Serve immediately.</ol>
