    <h2>Kelsey Berta</h2>
    <p>I am from New Jersey. I was in Rexburg for the past year, but I have recently changed my major from financial economics because I have transitioned to all online.
       I was born in New Jersey and love it. The food and greenery is the best part. </p>
    <p>I am engaged to my high school sweetheart. I have a corgi redheeler mix who turned one on September 8th. I got him at 6 weeks old and he is so cuddly. 
        He is all bark and no bite and will definitely bark at you if you're walking on the street. I am the assistant manager at a bakery where I decorate cakes 
        and make sandwiches and food (a weird job combo). I love my job because it's one of those fun jobs kids wish they did when they are older.
        I am taking this course because I have changed my major and don't know exactly where in the technology field I want to be. </p>
